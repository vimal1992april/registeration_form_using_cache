# Dynamic Registration Form with Rails Admin & React
This project is a dynamic multi-section registration form where form fields and sections are managed from Rails Admin and rendered dynamically on the frontend. Users can navigate through sections using Next/Previous buttons and submit their responses to a Rails API.
